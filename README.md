## Welcome to the GA4GH-Metadata Standards Repository

The *GA4GH-Metadata* repository contains definitions for structures, relations and attributes of biological (individuals, biosamples ...) and procedural (experiments, analyses ...) data objects, to facilitate the exchange of data and federation of analyses in the context of the Global Alliance for Genommics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)).

The metadata specifications presented here were developed by the GA4GH's Metadata Task Team, as part of the (now frozen) general [GA4GH data schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh-schemas/).

The website version of this page can be accessed [here](http://meta.ga4ghdata.org).
